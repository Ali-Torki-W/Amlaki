Declaration of Ownership and Development of the Application “Amlaki”

I, Ali Torki, hereby declare that I have been nurturing the idea of the application “Amlaki” since 2025/02/18  and officially started its development on 2025/09/12

“Amlaki” is a web-based application aimed at solving the problems of buying, selling, and renting real estate properties.
The distinct feature of this project is its focus on security — not only operational security but also the complete safety of all transactions, supported by thorough verification of properties, owners, agencies, and even buyers.
The ultimate goal of this project is to prevent issues such as fraud in real estate transactions.

I hereby affirm that I am the sole intellectual and material owner of this idea, and any unauthorized use or adaptation of this idea is strictly prohibited.
